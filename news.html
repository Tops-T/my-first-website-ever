                 <h3>Kendrick Lamar: untitled unmastered (Top Dawg/Aftermath/Interscope, 2016)</h3>

                    <p>Recently crowned king of rap though Lamar may be, this album in itself isn’t that big a deal — it’s just an outtakes collection, eight songs rejected from last year’s To Pimp a Butterfly through no fault of their own — it’s just that Butterfly was complete as is. The big deal is how intense, committed, and engaging even his outtakes are, and how well they cohere into a separate musical entity.<br />

                    More than deliberately unfinished (which on the slow, mostly a cappella interlude “untitled 04/08.14.2014” and the long, multipartite, disorganized song pastiche “untitled 07/2014-2016” it certainly is), the album is deliberately small. Where on the epic Butterfly everything unfolded over a sprawling scale that allowed for shifts in voice, elaborations on tropes, and all sorts of developments plotwise, 
                    here songs of similar mood and instrumental texture combine to produce a tight miniature that shares fluttering horns, liquid bass, and contemporary political themes with its predecessor while lacking the extended, novelistic narrative framework. The hooks emerge more quickly, especially the sour, slithering drums on “untitled 05/09.21.2014” and the spacey keyboard slide on “untitled 08/09.26.2014.
                    ” Lamar chatters and exclaims and runs laps all over the record, reaching new levels of eerie pseudomelodic vocal overactivity on “untitled 02/06.23.2014” and the first third of “untitled 07/2014-2016.
                    ” The mood is darker and tenser than on Butterfly, which included more peaceful, airy, relaxed moments than you’d expect given the outspoken political content. Yet at the same time the effect is positive; hearing Lamar rhyme over a dreamy, gossamer jazz band — at once a crazy musical innovation and a prescient racial metaphor — proves refreshing, affirming,
                    a long drink of cold water. This band once again qualifies as Lamar’s shrewdest political statement, evoking familiar-sounding psychedelic jazz even as it zaps you with the shock of the new. The louder, tougher drumming doesn’t hurt either.<br />

                    Simultaneously distinct from Butterfly and a natural outgrowth, this is a brilliant way to follow an untoppable album, and it makes me wonder about directions he might pursue in the future. Decades ago, Lamar’s clear spiritual guide Sun Ra would release several albums a year, most of them about this length. Without resorting to the mixtape route,
                    this is unlikely to happen today — labels just don’t work that way anymore. 
                    But should Lamar happen to share my pipe dream, it would allow him a way to avoid the trappings of the Statement Album while making each album work as a statement, and I’d love to see him try.  </p><br />

                    <P>Out of everything that went down during the Grammys, Kendrick Lamar’s performance was probably the most notable because of the political message that his performance included. Kendrick Lamar definitely does use his music to share his prospective and his struggles in life.</P>
