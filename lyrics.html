					I got a bone to pick <br />
					I don't want you monkey mouth motherfuckers sittin' in my throne again <br />
					(Aye aye nigga what's happenin' nigga, K Dot back in the hood nigga) <br /> 
					I'm mad (He mad), but I ain't stressin' <br />
					True friends, one question <br />

					Bitch where you when I was walkin'? <br />
					Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta) <br />
					Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta <br />
					Black man taking no losses <br />
					Bitch where you when I was walkin'? <br />
					Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta) <br />
					Everybody wanna cut the legs off him <br />

					When you got the yams (What's the yams?) <br />
					The yam is the power that be <br />
					You can smell it when I'm walking down the street <br />
					(Oh yes we can, oh yes we can) <br />
					I can dig rapping, but a rapper with a ghost writer <br />
					What the fuck happened? <br />
					(Oh no) I swore I wouldn't tell <br />
					But most of you share bars like you got the bottom bunk in a two man cell <br />
					(A two man cell) <br />
					Something's in the water (Something's in the water) <br />
					And if I got a brown nose for some gold then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller <br />

					Bitch where you when I was walkin'? <br />
					Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta) <br />
					Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta <br />
					Black man taking no losses <br />
					Bitch where you when I was walkin'? <br />
					Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta) <br />
					Everybody wanna cut the legs off him <br />

					When you got the yams (What's the yams?) <br />
					The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor <br />
					Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires <br />
					24/7, 365 days times two <br />
					I was contemplatin' gettin' on stage <br />
					Just to go back to the hood see my enemies and say... <br />

					Bitch where you when I was walkin'? <br />
					Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta) <br />
					Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta <br />
					Black man taking no losses <br />
					Bitch where you when I was walkin'? <br />
					Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta) <br />
					Everybody wanna cut the legs off him <br />

					You goat mouth mammy fucker <br />
					I was gonna kill a couple rappers but they did it to themselves <br />
					Everybody's suicidal they don't even need my help <br />
					This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail <br />
					If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left <br />
					Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin' "Compton" <br />
					I should probably run for Mayor when I'm done, to be honest <br />
					And I put that on my Mama and my baby boo too <br />
					Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin' woo woo <br />
					Ah yeah fuck the judge <br />
					I made it past 25 and there I was <br />
					A little nappy headed nigga with the world behind him <br />
					Life ain't shit but a fat vagina <br />
					Screamin' "Annie are you ok? Annie are you ok?" <br />
					Limo tinted with the gold plates <br />
					Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast <br />
					From a peasant to a prince to a motherfucking king <br />

					Bitch where was you when I was walkin'- <br />
					[POP] <br />
					(By the time you hear the next pop, the funk shall be within you) <br />
					[POP] <br />
					Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta) <br />
					Everybody wanna cut the legs off him (King Kunta) Kunta <br />
					Black man taking no losses <br />
					Bitch where was you when I was walkin' <br />
					Now I run the game got the whole world talkin' (King Kunta) <br />
					Everybody wanna cut the legs off him <br />

					(Funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk) <br />
					We want the funk <br />
					We want the funk <br />
					(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) <br />
					We want the funk <br />
					(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) <br />
					We want the funk <br />
					(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) <br />
					We want the funk <br />
					(Do you want the funk?) <br />
					We want the funk <br />
					(Do you want the funk?) <br />
					We want the funk <br />
					(Now if I give you the funk, you gon' take it) <br />
					We want the funk <br />
					I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence <br />

					Alls my life I has to fight, nigga<br />
					Alls my life I...<br />
					Hard times like God<br />
					Bad trips like: "God!"<br />
					Nazareth, I'm fucked up<br />
					Homie you fucked up<br />
					But if God got us then we gon' be alright<br />

					[Hook - Pharrell Williams:]<br />
					Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
					Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
					We gon' be alright<br />
					Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br />
					Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
					Huh? We gon' be alright<br />
					Nigga, we gon' be alright<br />
					Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright<br />

					Uh, and when I wake up<br />
					I recognize you're lookin' at me for the pay cut<br />
					Behind my side we lookin' at you from the face down<br />
					What mac-11 even boom with the bass down<br />
					Schemin'! And let me tell you bout my life<br />
					Painkillers only put me in the twilight<br />
					What pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight<br />
					Now tell my mama I love her but this what I like<br />
					Lord knows, 20 of 'em in my Chevy<br />
					Tell 'em all to come and get me, reapin' everything I sow<br />
					So my karma come and Heaven no preliminary hearing<br />
					So my record and my motherfucking gang can stand in silence for the record<br />
					Tell the world I know it's too late<br />
					Boys and the girls think I gone cray<br />
					Try and fight my vices all day<br />
					Won't you please believe when I say<br />

					[Pre-Hook:]<br />
					When you know, we been hurt, been down before, nigga<br />
					When my pride was low, lookin' at the world like, "where do we go, nigga?"<br />
					And we hate Popo, wanna kill us dead in the street for sure, nigga<br />
					I'm at the preacher's door<br />
					My knees gettin' weak and my gun might blow but we gon' be alright<br />

					[Hook]<br />

					What you want, a house or a car<br />
					40 acres and a mule, a piano a guitar<br />
					Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm a dog<br />
					Motherfucker you can live at the mall<br />
					I can see the evil, I can tell it I know when it's illegal<br />
					I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero<br />
					Thinkin' of my partner put the candy, paint it on the regal<br />
					Diggin' in my pocket ain't a profit, big enough to feed you<br />
					Everyday my logic, get another dollar just to keep you<br />
					In the presence of your chico... ah!<br />
					I don't talk about it, be about it, everyday I see cool<br />
					If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you<br />
					Pet dog, pet dog, pet dog, my dog that's all<br />
					Pick back and chat I shut the back for y'all<br />
					I rap, I'm black, on track and rest assured<br />
					My rights, my wrongs I write till I'm right with God<br />

					[Pre-Hook]<br />

					[Hook]<br />

					I keep my head up high<br />
					I cross my heart and hope to die<br />
					Lovin' me is complicated<br />
					Too afraid, a lot of changes<br />
					I'm alright and you're a favorite<br />
					Dark nights in my prayers<br />

					I remembered you was conflicted<br />
					Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same<br />
					Abusing my power full of resentment<br />
					Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br />
					Found myself screamin' in the hotel room<br />
					I didn't wanna self destruct, the evils of Lucy was all around me<br />
					So I went runnin' for answers<br />
				    </p>
				    <h3 id="These-walls"><q>These walls</q></h3>
				    <p>
					I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence<br />
					Sometimes, I did the same<br />

					If these walls could talk [x6]<br />

					[Anna Wise:]<br />
					Sex, she just want to close her eyes and sway<br />
					If you, if you, if you exercise your right to work it out<br />
					Its true, its true, its true, shout out to the birthday girls say hey<br />
					Say hey, everyone deserves a night to play<br />
					And shes plays only when you tell her no<br />

					[Hook - Bilal:]<br />
					If these walls could talk<br />
					I can feel your reign when it cries gold lives inside of you<br />
					If these walls could talk<br />
					I love it when I’m in it, I love it when I’m in it<br />

					If these walls could talk they’d tell me to swim good<br />
					No boat I float better than he would<br />
					No life jacket I’m not the guard in Nazareth<br />
					But your flood can be misunderstood<br />
					Wall telling me they full of pain, resentment<br />
					Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension<br />
					Me? I’m just a tenant<br />
					My lord said these walls vacant more than a minute<br />
					These walls are vulnerable, exclamation<br />
					Interior pink, color coordinated<br />
					I interrogated every nook and cranny<br />
					I mean its still amazing before they couldn’t stand me<br />
					These walls want to cry tears<br />
					These walls happier when I’m here<br />
					These walls never could hold up<br />
					Everytime I come around demolition might crush<br />

					[Hook]<br />

					If these walls could talk they’d tell me to go deep<br />
					Yelling at me continuously I can see<br />
					Your defense mechanism is my decision<br />
					Knock these walls down that’s my religion<br />
					Walls feeling like they ready to close in<br />
					I suffocate then catch my second wind<br />
					I resonate in these walls<br />
					I don’t know how long I can wait in these walls<br />
					I’ve been on these streets too long looking at you from the outside in<br />
					They sing the same old song about how they walls are always the cleanest<br />
					I beg to differ, I must’ve missed them<br />
					I’m not involved I’d rather diss them<br />
					I’d rather call all you put your wall up<br />
					Cause when I come around demolition gon’ crush<br />

					[Hook]<br />

					If your walls could talk they’d tell you it’s too late<br />
					Your destiny accepted your fate<br />
					Burn accessories and stash them where they are<br />
					Take the recipe, the bible and god<br />
					Wall telling you that commissary is low<br />
					Race wars happening no calling CO<br />
					No calling your mother to save you<br />
					Homies say to you, you're reputable, not acceptable<br />
					Your behavior is Sammy Da Bull like a killer that turned snitch<br />
					Walls is telling me you a bitch<br />
					You pray for appeals hoping the warden could afford them<br />
					That sentence so important<br />
					Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"<br />
					Retaliation is strong you even dream about me<br />
					Killed my homeboy and God spared your life<br />
					Dumb criminal got indicted the same night<br />
					So when you play this song rewind the first verse<br />
					About me abusing my power so you can hurt<br />
					About me and her in the shower whenever she horny<br />
					About me and her in the after hours of the morning<br />
					About her baby daddy currently serving life<br />
					And how she think about you until we meet up at night<br />
					About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her<br />
					And how she fucking on a famous rapper<br />
					Walls could talk<br />
					
					I remember you was conflicted<br />
					Misusing your influence<br />
					Sometimes I did the same<br />
					Abusing my power full of resentment<br />
					Resentment that turned into a deep depression<br />
					Found myself screaming in a hotel room<br />
